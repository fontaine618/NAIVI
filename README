# Node attribute imputation using variational inference (NAIVI)

Author: **Simon Fontaine** (simfont@umich.edu)

## Current Status



## To do list

[ ] Check why it is slow slow for large network (hypthesis: condition is too stringent)
[ ] Remove grad computation
[ ] Check M Step with new VMP
[ ] Initialization
    [ ] Use ADVI first? VMP is then just a refinement?
    [x] I think just breaking symmetry should be fine ...
[ ] JIT?
[ ] ELBO MC probably better for early stopping & model selection:
    - Indeed, I note that the MC one seems to increase with iteration
      (up to noise), while the LB one decreaases at some point.
[ ] MNAR model
    - should be fairly easy
    - add an argument mnar: bool
    - triggers _initialize_missingness_model
    - which reads in the two covariate models to see where the missing values are
    - create a binary model just like the binary covariates
    - parameter update will need a proximal step
[ ] Multinomial model
[ ] Implement AIC, BIC


## Changelog

### Version 0.1.0

Implemented methods:
- Stochastic VI with reparameterization trick (VIMC)
- Direct optimization (ADVI)
- MLE & MAP
- MICE, MissForest, mean imputation (no network)
- MCMC (No missing values allowed)
- NerworkSmoothing: average of the neighbors until stable

Under development:
- Variational message passing (VMP) with multivariate normal variational approximation
