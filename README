# Node attribute imputation using variational inference (NAIVI)

Author: **Simon Fontaine** (simfont@umich.edu)

## To do list

### VMP 

[x] Implement affine parameters update
[ ] Implement ELBO for logistic fragment
    [x] Quadratic
    [ ] MK
    [ ] Tilted
[x] Implement wrapper similar to ADVI/VIMC
[x] ELBO: MC at each factor (to check elbo computation/Logistic LB)
[x] ELBO: Like VIMC (to check messages)
[x] Figure out why mean is never updated ???
    [x] Break symmetry?
[x] Profile and make faster
    - more than 50% time is spent inverting matrices
    - need to check if some can be avoided, by I think this
    is the best I can do ...
[x] Add true values with some metrics
    [x] Do a fit_and_evaluate method
[ ] Initialization
    [ ] Use ADVI first? VMP is then just a refinement?
    [x] I think just breaking symmetry should be fine ...
[x] Memoize covariances:
    - if instantiated from mean and covariance, store them too
    - when variance is called, check if it is stored. If yes, just return.
      If no, compute it and store it.
[ ] JIT?
[ ] ELBO MC probably better for early stopping & model selection:
    - Indeed, I note that the MC one seems to increase with iteration
      (up to noise), while the LB one decreaases at some point.
[ ] MNAR model

remember to run with -O

## Changelog

### Version 0.1.0

Implemented methods:
- Stochastic VI with reparameterization trick (VIMC)
- Direct optimization (ADVI)
- MLE & MAP
- MICE, MissForest, mean imputation (no network)
