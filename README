# VMP: To do list

[x] Implement affine parameters update
[ ] Implement ELBO for logistic fragment
    [x] Quadratic
    [ ] MK
    [ ] Tilted
[ ] Implement wrapper similar to ADVI/VIMC
[x] ELBO: MC at each factor (to check elbo computation/Logistic LB)
[x] ELBO: Like VIMC (to check messages)
[ ] Figure out why mean is never updated ???
    [ ] Break symmetry?
[ ] Profile and make faster
[ ] Add true values with some metrics
    [x] Do a fit_and_evaluate method
[ ] Initialization
    [ ] Use ADVI first? VMP is then just a refinement?

# VMP: Ideas

[x] Memoize covariances:
    - if instantiated from mean and covariance, store them too
    - when variance is called, check if it is stored. If yes, just return.
      If no, compute it and store it.
[ ] JIT?
