# VMP: To do list

[x] Implement affine parameters update
[ ] Implement ELBO for logistic fragment
    [x] Quadratic
    [ ] MK
    [ ] Tilted
[ ] Implement wrapper similar to ADVI/VIMC
[x] ELBO: MC at each factor (to check elbo computation/Logistic LB)
[x] ELBO: Like VIMC (to check messages)

# VMP: Ideas

[x] Memoize covariances:
    - if intantiated from mean and covariance, store them too
    - when variance is called, check if it is stored. If yes, just return.
      If no, compute it and store it.
[ ] JIT?
